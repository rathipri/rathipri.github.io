Hi, I’m Pri, and I enjoy working with data to make sense of the world around us. My background is in reporting, visualization, modeling and governance. I was drawn to the field of data analytics because of its practical impact—helping people make better decisions by understanding the stories data can tell. Whether it’s finding trends in large datasets or creating visualizations that make complex topics easier to grasp, I’m motivated by the idea of using data to solve real problems.

By combining statistics, programming, and domain knowledge to answer questions and guide action, the field can be ever-evolving, and that’s part of what keeps me excited about it. This portfolio is a collection of projects I’ve worked on—each one an opportunity to explore something new, build my skills, and learn along the way. Thanks for stopping by, and feel free to get in touch!
